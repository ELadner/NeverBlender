# NeverBlender

NeverBlender enables creating custom content (creatures, weapons and
armor, placeable items, etc) for Bioware's computer game
"Neverwinter Nights". Tools for both importing and exporting Bioware
ASCII .mdl files are provided.

## What's this repository?

This is basically a fork of the original SVN repository at Blender
project site (https://projects.blender.org/projects/neverblender/),
converted to git so that people can fork it easier. I can't promise
to do merge requests and all, but I do hope that someone will
pick up this project and get it working on modern Blender versions
and start actually maintain it.

I'm not a Python guru and people who started working on the project
basically did things that are too clever for me. I had no idea how
to fix the thing. I hope people can somehow bring it up to speed.
