	* lib/Geometry.py:
	Fixed a few bugs having to do with things being in the wrong place
	or being where they don't belong at all.  It now imports without
	any errors.

	* lib/Model.py:
	Uncommented the stuff having to do with the Geometry model since
	it works now :)

	* lib/Trimesh.py.old, lib/Trimesh.py, lib/TrimeshGeometry.py:
	Moved the original Trimesh.py to Trimesh.py.old since it's now
	mostly depreciated but I don't feel comfortable deleting it just
	yet.  Replaced it by moving TrimeshGeometry to Trimesh.

	* lib/nwnmdlexport.py:
	Changed it to use the new Trimesh class.  Once we're certain this
	all works we can remove the code for the old Trimesh class - for
	now I just commented it out.

2005-10-15 20:12 Joshua Gooding <josh@gooding-online.com>
	* lib/Geometry.py:
	Minor changes to the Geometry registration system.  In particular,
	unrecognized geometry types are now treated as dummies.

	* lib/TrimeshGeometry.py:
	Brand new file!  This implements a version of Trimesh that is a
	subclass of Geometry.  Hopefully once this is stable it will
	replace Trimesh.py.

	* lib/Model.py:
	Added (and commented out) a few lines of code to provide a
	convenient way of adding an whole tree of geometry once the
	Geometry model is finished.

	* lib/ModelFile.py:
	Used variable-argument stuff to make it so ModelFile doesn't have
	to know about every single argument Model's __init__ takes.

	* lib/Script.py:
	Modified to be compatible with slight changes in Geometry
	interface.  Not that any of this actually works yet.
	
2005-10-15 15:05 Joshua Gooding <josh@gooding-online.com>
	* lib/ModelFile.py, lib/Model.py, lib/Script.py, lib/Geometry.py
	Of course, as soon as I commit I realize I should add some
	additional comments to all these files.
	
2005-10-15 14:40 Joshua Gooding <josh@gooding-online.com>
	* lib/ModelFile.py, lib/Model.py:
	Factored ModelFile into two different classes.  Model now handles
	the actual conversion to MDL format, while ModelFile is a wrapper
	around Model that allows it to actually save this data to a file.
	Also moved things in a more Python-centric direction by using
	property descriptors where appropriate.  ModelFile has old-style
	accessors alongside the properties for backward compatibility.

	* lib/Script.py:
	The beginnings of nwnscript support.

	* lib/Geometry.py:
	Beginnings of a new Geometry class to be the superclass of things
	like Dummy and Trimesh.  Not yet actually used.

2005-10-11 15:53 Joshua Gooding <josh@gooding-online.com>
	* nwnmdlexport.py, nwnmdlexporthook.py:
	Moved (and improved) the NeverBlender-lib-finding-code from
	nwnmdlexport.py to the new file nwnmdlexporthook.py.  This way we
	don't have to copy nwnmdlexport.py into the scripts directory
	every time we make a change.  Also moved nwnmdlexport.py into the
	lib directory.
	
2005-08-22 01:12 Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py:
	Comments that explain what SHOULD happen in animation export.
	I hope these amuse greppers. I hope they're informative to
	people who may expand this without my notice.
	
	* lib/Animation.py:
	Added more classes and shit that may be necessary once we
	actually export animations and shit.
	
	* technicalmanual.dbk:
	This thing was added. Boilerplateshit copied. Content is missing.

	* general:
	I'm now using Eclipse.

2005-05-15 14:04 Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlimport.py: 
	This thing was largely updated to work with the "new" (ahem)
	Blender API, since people really really ask a lot about this.
	Note that the geometry importing seems to work; I have no idea
	how well the animation importing works! It may even be
	broken (see getorientationkey() for stuff).

	* setup-test.py:
	Deleted, because Blender already has system information tool that
	prints out stuff about the Python setup as well.

	* manual.dbk:
	Added documentation on PYTHONPATH.

2005-02-15 14:00  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* setup-test.py
	Created. Hopefully more useful in future for getting tech
	support less painful.

2005-02-14 20:09  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	Just adding this change log entry to see if the CVS finally
	works =)

2004-07-22 24:29  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/Animation.py:
	Damn, this is probably some insignificant yet headache-inducing
	part of the NWN model spec. It's a new library file anyway.

	There's the class Animation, which contains the stuff for
	the animation props. There eventually will be AnimationEvent
	for game cues.
	AnimationNode is, at the time, in there, but the functionality
	should actually be the responsibility of Trimesh, Dummy etc.
	so this stuff will probably need to be subclassed.

	* nwnmdlexport.py:
	There's extremely rudimentary and completely non-working
	implementation of animation exporting out there.
	Thoughtfully, I made it skip the phase when I committed
	this to CVS, so I hope things aren't broken right now.
	
	* lib/ModelFile.py:
	Added support for setanimationscale (and {get,set}AnimationScale
	methods)
	Added serialization of animation objects (in other words, you can
	do mf.addAnimation(animobject) and it will be written to the
	model file the same way object nodes are written).

	* lib/ModelFile.py (ModelFile.setClassification): 
	Added some sanity checking.

2004-05-14 22:13  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py
	Quick fixes to make it work on 2.33. Uses Euler 
	in Trimesh's _orientation property and Quartenion in
	serializing, instead of using lists and NwnMath functions.

	* lib/SceneHelpers.py, lib/FindFromList.py
	Nuked FindFromList.py and moved the functions (mostly unused!)
	to SceneHelpers.

2004-04-18 19:35  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/NBLog.py, lib/Props.py, nwnmdlexport.py
	Added support for logging stuff to a logfile.
	(The unscrollable Windows terminal windows and like tend to
	suck.)

	* lib/SceneHelpers.py
	Added actionlist() function to get the list of actions.
	We're getting somewhere with this animation thing.

2004-03-30 00:00  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/NBLog.py
	A whole new library file for the purpose of logging things
	intelligently - or at least logging them intelligently in far
	future. Beats peppering the code with "print" commands....
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/ModelFile.py, lib/Trimesh.py, lib/Props.py
	Updated to make whole use of the NBLog facility.

2004-03-11 21:07  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/ModelFile.py
	Added "filedependancy" support.

	* lib/Emitter.py
	A brand new library file. Guess what it's supposed to cover
	in the future. =)

2004-02-08 22:32  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, nwnmdlimport.py
	Added the Blender 2.32 headers. Now the files can be symlinked
	to ~/.blender/scripts and they show up in File - Import and
	File - Export. Long live the Foundation!

2003-12-02 21:30  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py
	PWK exporting bug *really* fixed. Changed recursion to use
	non-global mfile and passed the ModelFile as a parameter.

	Clears up the mfile object list before processobject()ing
	everything. This will fix the bug where stuff got written
	multiple times on separate runs. (I hate Python's objects,
	I really do...)

	* lib/ModelFile.py
	Added tons of file paranoia: will try to nuke the file
	if it exists beforehand, tries to flush and close the file
	very very properly. Will try to detect if there's
	0 objects to be written, and it also detects screwed-up 
	object string conversion (like trying to convert wrong
	object to string.

	* manual.dbk
	Added some frothing about how to fix messed-up scaling and
	rotation. Summary: Thou Shalt Not Touch The Object Mode.
	
	
2003-11-28 22:41  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py
	PWK exporting bug fixed.

2003-11-28 22:04  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/Trimesh.py (Trimesh._texverts_as_string)
	Looks like Yann's lambda voodoo with texverts was a bit buggy.
	I was getting literal tuplespam in the files.

	* lib/Trimesh.py (Trimesh.addFace)
	More meaningful error messages. I suppose.

	* lib/ModelFile.py (writeToFile)
	Closes the file, too.
	
2003-11-11 23:50  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/ModelFile.py
	Largish overhaul of the recursive object tree handling.
	Now, it's possible to parent meshes to armatures, and these
	are handled correctly.
	This is a *major* step towards animation support. Also, now the
	recursive parent handling seems to work as it's advertised to.

	Oh, and since I now understand how the hell the Blender's
	Actions are supposed to work, I'll implement the animation
	sequences that way anyway in the future... (The question
	remains - where's the API?)

	Also of note is the fact that I develop on Blender 2.30, and
	the hideous Python issue was fixed by downgrading my
	Windows python installation to 2.2.3.
	
2003-11-11 20:35  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py
	Fixed an idiotic typo with indentation. Now it will generate the
	child object tree just as advertised.
	
	* lib/Props.py, lib/ModelFile.py
	Added FILES.outputdirectory property, which defaults to
	current output directory. Code is there to support it, and if
	I wrote it correctly once, it appears to work. However,
	my Python library in Windows seems to be highly f%&$#d up so
	I can't test this. And it won't run without Python properly
	installed, as it needs the "os" module which isn't bundled with
	Blender for one excuse or another.

2003-10-14  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/ModelFile.py (ModelFile.writeToFile): 
	Moved filedependancy before the model definition start (as it
	appears to be in some Bioware models) and changed "endmodel" line
	to "donemodel". Now the models can be previewed
	in MdlViewer *and* NWN-J3D! =) (Or that's what my 2-second testing
	shows. Without even running this program. I just edited an
	existing model and NWN-J3D suddenly started to work. =)

2003-09-23 21:50  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py, lib/Props.py:
	Now handles item tree recursively. Also added was the support
	for SCENE.geometry=...
	
2003-09-23 01:23  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	2.28 changes. It compiles, so we ship it.

2003-09-23 00:42  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py:
	Fixed the idiotic typos added in the last commit. I knew it
	wouldn't run right away.
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py: 
	Okay, so I tried to *run* the exporter first time in 2.28. Yay.
	Apparently 2.28 [and switch to Python 2.3] broke exporter as well.
	I'm a little bit peeved. A lot of things fixed, along them
	the few things Blender specifically warned me of (Object.Get()).

	* ChangeLog:
	Reordered entries - newest entries always first.
	Also, uses the modern datestamp format.

2003-09-15 22:27  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlimport.py: 
	Changed the GUI. Now uses Window.FileSelector.

	* nwnmdlexport.py: 
	Moved the "Stuff from Objects to Trimesh" to a separate
	function. COMPLETELY UNTESTED, MAY BE BROKEN.
	
2003-08-17 20:04  Urpo Lankinen <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlimport.py:
	Added a rudimentary GUI file selector. Not tested it because
	FileReader doesn't seem to be there in Windows Blender
	2.28a. Or something.

2003-07-07 18:11  Urpo Lankinen <wwwwolf@iki.fi>
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	Added the support for wirecolor and specular, which are read from
	Materials. Currently only the first material is used.
	This feature is quite useless though.

	* nwnmdlimport.py, lib/NwnMath.py:	
	Took Yann's mathematics routines to convert between Blender
	'euler' and NWN 'orientation', and moved them into lib/NwnMath.py
	file.
	Also tested the importer first time. Yeah, it's dog slow...
