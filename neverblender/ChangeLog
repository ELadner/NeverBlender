	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	Added the support for wirecolor and specular, which are read from
	Materials. Currently only the first material is used.
	This feature is quite useless though.

	* nwnmdlimport.py, lib/NwnMath.py:	
	Took Yann's mathematics routines to convert between Blender
	'euler' and NWN 'orientation', and moved them into lib/NwnMath.py
	file.
	Also tested the importer first time. Yeah, it's dog slow...

	* nwnmdlimport.py:
	Added a rudimentary GUI file selector. Not tested it because
	FileReader doesn't seem to be there in Windows Blender
	2.28a. Or something.
