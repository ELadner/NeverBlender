	* lib/NBLog.py
	A whole new library file for the purpose of logging things
	intelligently - or at least logging them intelligently in far
	future. Beats peppering the code with "print" commands....
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/ModelFile.py, lib/Trimesh.py, lib/Props.py
	Updated to make whole use of the NBLog facility.

2004-03-11 21:07  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/ModelFile.py
	Added "filedependancy" support.

	* lib/Emitter.py
	A brand new library file. Guess what it's supposed to cover
	in the future. =)

2004-02-08 22:32  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, nwnmdlimport.py
	Added the Blender 2.32 headers. Now the files can be symlinked
	to ~/.blender/scripts and they show up in File - Import and
	File - Export. Long live the Foundation!

2003-12-02 21:30  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py
	PWK exporting bug *really* fixed. Changed recursion to use
	non-global mfile and passed the ModelFile as a parameter.

	Clears up the mfile object list before processobject()ing
	everything. This will fix the bug where stuff got written
	multiple times on separate runs. (I hate Python's objects,
	I really do...)

	* lib/ModelFile.py
	Added tons of file paranoia: will try to nuke the file
	if it exists beforehand, tries to flush and close the file
	very very properly. Will try to detect if there's
	0 objects to be written, and it also detects screwed-up 
	object string conversion (like trying to convert wrong
	object to string.

	* manual.dbk
	Added some frothing about how to fix messed-up scaling and
	rotation. Summary: Thou Shalt Not Touch The Object Mode.
	
	
2003-11-28 22:41  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py
	PWK exporting bug fixed.

2003-11-28 22:04  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/Trimesh.py (Trimesh._texverts_as_string)
	Looks like Yann's lambda voodoo with texverts was a bit buggy.
	I was getting literal tuplespam in the files.

	* lib/Trimesh.py (Trimesh.addFace)
	More meaningful error messages. I suppose.

	* lib/ModelFile.py (writeToFile)
	Closes the file, too.
	
2003-11-11 23:50  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/ModelFile.py
	Largish overhaul of the recursive object tree handling.
	Now, it's possible to parent meshes to armatures, and these
	are handled correctly.
	This is a *major* step towards animation support. Also, now the
	recursive parent handling seems to work as it's advertised to.

	Oh, and since I now understand how the hell the Blender's
	Actions are supposed to work, I'll implement the animation
	sequences that way anyway in the future... (The question
	remains - where's the API?)

	Also of note is the fact that I develop on Blender 2.30, and
	the hideous Python issue was fixed by downgrading my
	Windows python installation to 2.2.3.
	
2003-11-11 20:35  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py
	Fixed an idiotic typo with indentation. Now it will generate the
	child object tree just as advertised.
	
	* lib/Props.py, lib/ModelFile.py
	Added FILES.outputdirectory property, which defaults to
	current output directory. Code is there to support it, and if
	I wrote it correctly once, it appears to work. However,
	my Python library in Windows seems to be highly f%&$#d up so
	I can't test this. And it won't run without Python properly
	installed, as it needs the "os" module which isn't bundled with
	Blender for one excuse or another.

2003-10-14  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* lib/ModelFile.py (ModelFile.writeToFile): 
	Moved filedependancy before the model definition start (as it
	appears to be in some Bioware models) and changed "endmodel" line
	to "donemodel". Now the models can be previewed
	in MdlViewer *and* NWN-J3D! =) (Or that's what my 2-second testing
	shows. Without even running this program. I just edited an
	existing model and NWN-J3D suddenly started to work. =)

2003-09-23 21:50  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py, lib/Props.py:
	Now handles item tree recursively. Also added was the support
	for SCENE.geometry=...
	
2003-09-23 01:23  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	2.28 changes. It compiles, so we ship it.

2003-09-23 00:42  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlexport.py:
	Fixed the idiotic typos added in the last commit. I knew it
	wouldn't run right away.
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py: 
	Okay, so I tried to *run* the exporter first time in 2.28. Yay.
	Apparently 2.28 [and switch to Python 2.3] broke exporter as well.
	I'm a little bit peeved. A lot of things fixed, along them
	the few things Blender specifically warned me of (Object.Get()).

	* ChangeLog:
	Reordered entries - newest entries always first.
	Also, uses the modern datestamp format.

2003-09-15 22:27  Urpo Lankinen  <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlimport.py: 
	Changed the GUI. Now uses Window.FileSelector.

	* nwnmdlexport.py: 
	Moved the "Stuff from Objects to Trimesh" to a separate
	function. COMPLETELY UNTESTED, MAY BE BROKEN.
	
2003-08-17 20:04  Urpo Lankinen <wwwwolf@iki.fi>

	* nwnmdlimport.py:
	Added a rudimentary GUI file selector. Not tested it because
	FileReader doesn't seem to be there in Windows Blender
	2.28a. Or something.

2003-07-07 18:11  Urpo Lankinen <wwwwolf@iki.fi>
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	Added the support for wirecolor and specular, which are read from
	Materials. Currently only the first material is used.
	This feature is quite useless though.

	* nwnmdlimport.py, lib/NwnMath.py:	
	Took Yann's mathematics routines to convert between Blender
	'euler' and NWN 'orientation', and moved them into lib/NwnMath.py
	file.
	Also tested the importer first time. Yeah, it's dog slow...
