	* lib/ModelFile.py (ModelFile.writeToFile): 
	Moved filedependancy before the model definition start (as it
	appears to be in some Bioware models) and changed "endmodel" line
	to "donemodel". Now the models can be previewed
	in MdlViewer *and* NWN-J3D! =) (Or that's what my 2-second testing
	shows. Without even running this program. I just edited an
	existing model and NWN-J3D suddenly started to work. =)

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py, lib/Props.py:
	Now handles item tree recursively. Also added was the support
	for SCENE.geometry=...

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	2.28 changes. It compiles, so we ship it.

	* nwnmdlexport.py:
	Fixed the idiotic typos added in the last commit. I knew it
	wouldn't run right away.
	
	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py: 
	Okay, so I tried to *run* the exporter first time in 2.28. Yay.
	Apparently 2.28 [and switch to Python 2.3] broke exporter as well.
	I'm a little bit peeved. A lot of things fixed, along them
	the few things Blender specifically warned me of (Object.Get()).

	* ChangeLog:
	Reordered entries - newest entries always first.
	Also, uses the modern datestamp format.

	* nwnmdlimport.py: 
	Changed the GUI. Now uses Window.FileSelector.

	* nwnmdlexport.py: 
	Moved the "Stuff from Objects to Trimesh" to a separate
	function. COMPLETELY UNTESTED, MAY BE BROKEN.

	* nwnmdlimport.py:
	Added a rudimentary GUI file selector. Not tested it because
	FileReader doesn't seem to be there in Windows Blender
	2.28a. Or something.

	* nwnmdlexport.py, lib/Trimesh.py:
	Added the support for wirecolor and specular, which are read from
	Materials. Currently only the first material is used.
	This feature is quite useless though.

	* nwnmdlimport.py, lib/NwnMath.py:	
	Took Yann's mathematics routines to convert between Blender
	'euler' and NWN 'orientation', and moved them into lib/NwnMath.py
	file.
	Also tested the importer first time. Yeah, it's dog slow...
