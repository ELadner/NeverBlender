The NeverBlender Tech Challenges Log
====================================

Since there's no blog for neverblender, and I damn well won't set up
one, and it wouldn't be updated much anyway, here's a file where I'll
record some specific challenges.

add stuff to the end. Please observe the date formats and such.)

Title: Unforgiving stuff in Actions

Well, a few weeks ago, I started really drilling down to the problem of
exporting Animations. Blender 2.33 and later has new NLA / Action api
that makes action exportation very feasible. It only has some small
problems in it.

My post to Elysiun: http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29077
Quoted for posterity:

    The idea is simple: I need to get orientation and position lists,
    all along the Action timeline, on keyframes (either based on
    constant intervals or possibly based on the keyframes on Action).

    Anyway, I have this problem: I can figure out what Actions are
    there in the scene. I can figure out what IPO channels are there
    in an Action (getAllChannelIpos()).

    But how do I find out what objects are animated in Actions, and
    how?

    I get a dictionary of Ipos keyed by Action channel names, which
    may or may not correspond to Armature Bone names. I can get
    IpoCurves out of the Ipo, but their names aren't related in anyway
    to objects themselves.

    I can build a list of Objects in the scene, and the only
    information I can get from them is that they're linked to the
    Armature! The objects are supposed to be linked to individual
    Bones. How do I get which Bone the Object is linked to - or the
    other way around? (Armature Bone only knows its children and
    parent.)

    I have this terribly stupid idea of doing this the big, stupid
    inelegant way - linking the Action, stepping through it and
    recording each and every object's location over the course of the
    animation.

Today, I found even more problems from this latter approach. How do I
get which Armatures are animated in Actions? There's
Action.setActive() (where's Action.unsetActive()???), which I suspect
is to be used on Armatures. But - hah - I *can* get Armature's
children from scnobjectchilds! There's some faint glimmer of hope
here!

Maybe that's the way???

So, here's one approach to figuring out animation data in ugly pseudocode:

    actionlist = list of actions
    armlist = list of armatures
    locdata, oridata = dictionary of (objectname: emptylist)

    foreach action from actionlist:

        length = action.getlength
        othercooldata = action.getothercooldata

        foreach armature from armlist:

            action.setactive(armature)

            foreach object from childrenof(armature):
                step_through_animation(0, length, stride):
                    oridata[object].push(object.getorientation)
                    locdata[object].push(object.getlocation)
