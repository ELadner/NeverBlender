NeverBlender is a package for Blender to deal with Neverwinter Nights
.mdl files.

The main tools are provided in
 - nwnmdlexport.py, which is a script for exporting Blender models
   to MDLs, and
 - nwnmdlimport.py, which imports NWN models to Blender.

COPYRIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION TERMS
================================

(c) The NeverBlender Contributors 2003
Distribute, modify and use however you please as long as you
retain this copyright notice and comply to the terms set forth in the
file COPYING. No warranty expressed or implied.

REAL DOCUMENTATION
==================

As of prerel-2, the documentation is now available in DocBook
format. You can try to read the manual.dbk file (it should be fairly
easy-to-read XML stuff), or produce readable source with any DocBook
converter. I have a HTML version on the NeverBlender web page,
generated using the "xmlto" utility.
